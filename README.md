## MiniGebra
Small clone of GeoGebra.

## Aim of the project
This clone will consist of simple graphical user interface written in PyQt5.
Users will be able to plot simple mathematical functions in on a plotting canvas. Canvas manipulation like zooming, changing colors and axis types will be possible. Functions to be plotted will be provided by the user as text input. This input will be parsed and interpreted by my own modules. There will be an option to save all the figures. There will be support for symbolic simplification and differentiation of inputed math expressions. Based on how much time I have for this project, I could add support for ODEs, systems of ODEs, slope fields, functions of 2 variables or complex functions. I might also add the possibility of parametric functions and their animations.
